# PeARS Lite


## Important info

*PeARS Lite* is a bare-bone version of PeARS which will allow you to index and search Web document in your language, locally and robustly. It is under active development, so please ensure to *git pull* often until we have a stable release!

*PeARS Lite* is provided as-is and is meant for personal use. Before you use it, please check the rules of your country on crawling Web content and displaying snippets. And be a good netizen: do not overload people's servers while indexing!


## Installation and Setup


##### 1. Clone this repo on your machine:

```
    git clone https://github.com/PeARSearch/PeARS-lite.git
```

##### 2. **Optional step** Setup a virtualenv in your directory.

If you haven't yet set up virtualenv on your machine, please install it via pip:

    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip

    sudo pip install virtualenv

Then change into the PeARS-orchard directory:

    cd PeARS-lite

Then run:

    virtualenv env && source env/bin/activate


##### 3. Install the build dependencies:

From the PeARS-orchard directory, run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


##### 4. **Optional step** Install further languages


If you want to search and index in several languages at the same time, you can add multilingual support to your English install. To do this:

    python3 install_language.py lc

where you should replace lc with a language code of your choice. For now, we are only supporting English (en) and German (de), but more languages are coming!


##### 5. Run your pear!

In the root of the repo, run:

    python3 run.py en

(The argument to *run.py* should be the code of your installation's default language. E.g. *en* for English, *de* for German, etc.)
